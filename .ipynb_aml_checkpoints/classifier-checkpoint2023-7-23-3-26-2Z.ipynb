Supported criteria are\n |      \"gini\" for the Gini impurity and \"log_loss\" and \"entropy\" both for the\n |      Shannon information gain, see :ref:`tree_mathematical_formulation`.\n |  \n |  splitter : {\"best\", \"random\"}, default=\"best\"\n |      The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported\n |      strategies are \"best\" to choose the best split and \"random\" to choose\n |      the best random split.\n |  \n |  max_depth : int, default=None\n |      The maximum depth of the tree.

This may have the effect of smoothing the model,\n |      especially in regression.\n |  \n |      - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.\n |      - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and\n |        `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum\n |        number of samples for each node.\n |  \n |      .. versionchanged:: 0.18\n |         Added float values for fractions.\n |  \n |  min_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0\n |      The minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all\n |      the input samples) required to be at a leaf node.

The features are always\n |      randomly permuted at each split, even if ``splitter`` is set to\n |      ``\"best\"``. When ``max_features < n_features``, the algorithm will\n |      select ``max_features`` at random at each split before finding the best\n |      split among them. But the best found split may vary across different\n |      runs, even if ``max_features=n_features``. That is the case, if the\n |      improvement of the criterion is identical for several splits and one\n |      split has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic behaviour\n |      during fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed to an integer.\n |      See :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.\n |  \n |  max_leaf_nodes : int, default=None\n |      Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.\n |      Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.\n |      If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.\n |  \n |  min_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0\n |      A node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity\n |      greater than or equal to this value.\n |  \n |      The weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::\n |  \n |          N_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity\n |                              - N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)\n |  \n |      where ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of\n |      samples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the\n |      left child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.\n |  \n |      ``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,\n |      if ``sample_weight`` is passed.\n |  \n |      .. versionadded:: 0.19\n |  \n |  class_weight : dict, list of dict or \"balanced\", default=None\n |      Weights associated with classes in the form ``{class_label: weight}``.\n |      If None, all classes are supposed to have weight one. For\n |      multi-output problems, a list of dicts can be provided in the same\n |      order as the columns of y.\n |  \n |      Note that for multioutput (including multilabel) weights should be\n |      defined for each class of every column in its own dict. For example,\n |      for four-class multilabel classification weights should be\n |      [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] instead of\n |      [{1:1}, {2:5}, {3:1}, {4:1}].\n |  \n |      The \"balanced\" mode uses the values of y to automatically adjust\n |      weights inversely proportional to class frequencies in the input data\n |      as ``n_samples / (n_classes * np.bincount(y))``\n |  \n |      For multi-output, the weights of each column of y will be multiplied.\n |  \n |      Note that these weights will be multiplied with sample_weight (passed\n |      through the fit method) if sample_weight is specified.\n |  \n |  ccp_alpha : non-negative float, default=0.0\n |      Complexity parameter used for Minimal Cost-Complexity Pruning. The\n |      subtree with the largest cost complexity that is smaller than\n |      ``ccp_alpha`` will be chosen. By default, no pruning is performed.

It is also\n |      known as the Gini importance [4]_.\n |  \n |      Warning: impurity-based feature importances can be misleading for\n |      high cardinality features (many unique values). See\n |      :func:`sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance` as an alternative.\n |  \n |  max_features_ : int\n |      The inferred value of max_features.\n |  \n |  n_classes_ : int or list of int\n |      The number of classes (for single output problems),\n |      or a list containing the number of classes for each\n |      output (for multi-output problems).\n |  \n |  n_features_in_ : int\n |      Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.\n |  \n |      .. versionadded:: 0.24\n |  \n |  feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)\n |      Names of features seen during :term:`fit`.

To\n |  reduce memory consumption, the complexity and size of the trees should be\n |  controlled by setting those parameter values.\n |  \n |  The :meth:`predict` method operates using the :func:`numpy.argmax`\n |  function on the outputs of :meth:`predict_proba`. This means that in\n |  case the highest predicted probabilities are tied, the classifier will\n |  predict the tied class with the lowest index in :term:`classes_`.\n |  \n |  References\n |  ----------\n |  \n |  ..
